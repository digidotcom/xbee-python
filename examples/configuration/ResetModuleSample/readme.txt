  Introduction
  ------------
  This sample Python application shows how to perform a software reset on the
  local XBee module.

  NOTE: This example uses the generic XBee device (XBeeDevice) class,
        but it can be applied to any other local XBee device class.


  Requirements
  ------------
  To run this example you will need:

    * One XBee radio in API mode and its corresponding carrier board (XBIB
      or XBee Development Board).
    * The XCTU application (available at www.digi.com/xctu).


  Compatible protocols
  --------------------
    * 802.15.4
    * Cellular
    * Cellular NB-IoT
    * DigiMesh
    * Point-to-Multipoint
    * Wi-Fi
    * ZigBee


  Example setup
  -------------
    1) Plug the XBee radio into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
       computer's USB or serial port.

    2) Ensure that the module is in API mode.
       For further information on how to perform this task, read the
       'Configuring Your XBee Modules' topic of the Getting Started guide.

    3) Set the port and baud rate of the XBee radio in the sample file.
       If you configured the module in the previous step with the XCTU, you
       will see the port number and baud rate in the 'Port' label of the device
       on the left view.


  Running the example
  -------------------
  First, build and launch the application. To test the functionality, check
  that the following message is printed out in the console of the launched
  application:

    "XBee module reset successfully"

  That message indicates that the module was reset correctly.

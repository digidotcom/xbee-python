  Introduction
  ------------
  This sample Python application shows how to get and set common parameters of
  the XBee device. Common parameters are split in cached and non-cached
  parameters. For that reason, the application refreshes the cached parameters
  before reading and displaying them. It then configures, reads and displays
  the value of non-cached parameters.

  The application uses the specific setters and getters provided by the XBee
  device object to configure and read the different parameters.

  NOTE: This example uses the generic XBee device (XBeeDevice) class, but it
        can be applied to any other local or remote XBee device class.


  Requirements
  ------------
  To run this example you will need:

    * One XBee radio in API mode and its corresponding carrier board (XBIB
      or XBee Development Board).
    * The XCTU application (available at www.digi.com/xctu).


  Compatible protocols
  --------------------
    * 802.15.4
    * DigiMesh
    * Point-to-Multipoint
    * ZigBee


  Example setup
  -------------
    1) Plug the XBee radio into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
       computer's USB or serial port.

    2) Ensure that the module is in API mode.
       For further information on how to perform this task, read the
       'Configuring Your XBee Modules' topic of the Getting Started guide.

    3) Set the port and baud rate of the XBee radio in the sample file class.
       If you configured the module in the previous step with the XCTU, you
       will see the port number and baud rate in the 'Port' label of the device
       on the left view.


  Running the example
  -------------------
  First, build and launch the application. To test the functionality, check
  that the output console displays the value of all the common (cached and
  non-cached) parameters. It should display something similar to this:

    Cached parameters
    ----------------------
    [...]

    Non-Cached parameters
    ----------------------
    [...]

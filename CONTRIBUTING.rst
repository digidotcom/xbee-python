How to Contribute
=================


Getting help
------------

To ask questions about the XBee Python library go to the
`Digi Forum <http://www.digi.com/support/forum>`_.


Reporting a bug
---------------

The way to report bugs is to use the
`GitHub issue tracker <http://github.com/digidotcom/xbee-python/issues>`_.
Before reporting a bug, please read the following points:

#. Make sure that what you are seeing is really a bug by checking the
   `documentation <https://xbplib.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_ and consulting 
   the `FAQs <https://xbplib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html>`_ section.
#. If you still think you have found a bug, make sure someone has not already
   reported it. See the list of
   `known issues <http://github.com/digidotcom/xbee-python/issues>`_.
#. If it has not been reported yet, create a new issue. Make sure to add enough
   detail so that the bug can be reproduced.

.. Note::
   The issue tracker is for bugs, not requests for help. Questions
   should be asked on the `Digi Forum <http://www.digi.com/support/forum>`_
   instead.


Suggesting a new feature
------------------------

#. Consult the `FAQs <https://xbplib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html>`_ 
   section to ensure that the behavior you would like the library to have is 
   not excluded.
#. Make sure someone has not already requested it. See the list of
   `known issues <http://github.com/digidotcom/xbee-python/issues>`_.
#. Submit your request in the issue tracker.


Contributing code
-----------------

#. Fork the `XBee Python library <http://github.com/digidotcom/xbee-python>`_
   repository (`how to fork a repo
   <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>`_).
#. Create a branch for your contribution. Use a name that defines the purpose
   of the additions/modifications.
#. Make your changes following the code style used in the library.
#. Submit a pull request (`how to create a pull request
   <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#next-steps>`_). A project
   developer will review your work and then merge your request into the
   project, or come back to you with comments and/or questions.

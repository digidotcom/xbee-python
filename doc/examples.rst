XBee Python samples
===================

The XBee Python Library includes several samples to demonstrate how to do the
following:

* Communicate with your modules
* Configure your modules
* Read the IO lines
* Perform other common operations

All of the sample applications are contained in the examples folder, organized
by category. Every sample includes the source code and a **readme.txt** file
to clarify the purpose and the required setup to launch the application.

Examples are split by categories:

* :ref:`samplesConfiguration`
* :ref:`samplesNetwork`
* :ref:`samplesCommunication`
* :ref:`samplesIO`


.. _samplesConfiguration:

Configuration samples
---------------------

Manage common parameters
````````````````````````

This sample application shows how to get and set common parameters of the XBee
device. Common parameters are split in cached and non-cached parameters. For
that reason, the application refreshes the cached parameters before reading and
displaying them. The application then configures, reads, and displays the value
of non-cached parameters.

The application uses the specific setters and getters provided by the XBee
device object to configure and read the different parameters.

You can locate the example in the following path:
**examples/configuration/ManageCommonParametersSample**

.. note::
   For more information about how to manage common parameters, see
   :ref:`configCommonParameters`.


Set and get parameters
``````````````````````

This sample application shows how to set and get parameters of a local or
remote XBee device. Use this method when you need to set or get the value of a
parameter that does not have its own getter and setter within the XBee device
object.

The application sets the value of four parameters with different value types:

* String
* Byte
* Array
* Integer

The application then reads the parameters from the device to verify that the
read values are the same as the values that were set.

You can locate the example in the following path:
**examples/configuration/SetAndGetParametersSample**

.. note::
   For more information about how to get and set other parameters, see
   :ref:`configOtherParameters`.


Reset module
````````````

This sample application shows how to perform a software reset on the local XBee
module.

You can locate the example in the following path:
**examples/configuration/ResetModuleSample**

.. note::
   For more information about how to reset a module, see
   :ref:`configReset`.


Connect to access point (Wi-Fi)
```````````````````````````````

This sample application shows how to configure a Wi-Fi module to connect to a
specific access point and read its addressing settings.

You can locate the example at the following path:
**examples/configuration/ConnectToAccessPoint**

.. note::
   For more information about connecting to an access point, see
   :ref:`configWiFi`.


.. _samplesNetwork:

Network samples
---------------

Discover devices
````````````````

This sample application demonstrates how to obtain the XBee network object
from a local XBee device and discover the remote XBee devices that compose the
network. The example adds a discovery listener, so the callbacks provided by
the listener object receive the events.

The remote XBee devices are printed out as soon as they are found during
discovery.

You can locate the example in the following path:
**examples/network/DiscoverDevicesSample**

.. note::
   For more information about how to perform a network discovery, see
   :ref:`discoverNetwork`.


.. _samplesCommunication:

Communication samples
---------------------

Send data
`````````

This sample application shows how to send data from the XBee device to another
remote device on the same network using the XBee Python Library. In this
example, the application sends data using a reliable transmission method. The
application blocks during the transmission request, but you are notified if
there is any error during the process.

The application sends data to a remote XBee device on the network with a
specific node identifier (name).

You can locate the example in the following path:
**examples/communication/SendDataSample**

.. note::

Send data asynchronously
````````````````````````

This sample application shows how to send data asynchronously from the XBee
device to another remote device on the same network using the XBee Python
Library. Transmitting data asynchronously means the execution is not blocked
during the transmit request, but you cannot determine if the data was sent
successfully.

The application sends data asynchronously to a remote XBee device on the
network with a specific node identifier (name).

digital input (button) and the other as ADC, and enables periodic sampling and
change detection. The device sends a sample every five seconds containing the
values of the two monitored lines. The device sends another sample every time
the button is pressed or released, which only contains the value of this
digital line.

The application registers a listener in the local device to receive and handle
all IO samples sent by the remote XBee module.

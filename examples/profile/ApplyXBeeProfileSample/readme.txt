  Introduction
  ------------
  This sample Python application shows how to apply an existing XBee profile
  to a XBee device.

  The application provides the profile file to the update method as well as a
  callback function to be notified of progress.

  NOTE: This example uses the generic XBee device (XBeeDevice) class, but it
        can be applied to any other local device class.


  Requirements
  ------------
  To run this example you will need:

    * One XBee radio in API mode and its corresponding carrier board (XBIB
      or XBee Development Board).
    * The XCTU application (available at www.digi.com/xctu).
    * The XBee profile file to update the device.


  Compatible hardware
  --------------------
    * Local XBee3 devices


  Compatible protocols
  --------------------
    * 802.15.4
    * DigiMesh
    * ZigBee


  Example setup
  -------------
    1) Plug the XBee radio into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
       computer's USB or serial port.

    2) Ensure that the module is in API mode.
       For further information on how to perform this task, read the
       'Configuring Your XBee Modules' topic of the Getting Started guide.

    3) Set the port and baud rate of the XBee radio in the sample file class.
       If you configured the module in the previous step with the XCTU, you
       will see the port number and baud rate in the 'Port' label of the device
       on the left view.

    4) Configure the path of the XBee profile file in the sample file class.


  Running the example
  -------------------
  First, build and launch the application. To test the functionality, check
  that the output console displays this message:

    "Updating profile '<profile_path>'..."

  Followed by percentage progress messages by task:

    "Updating XBee firmware: 1%"
    "Updating XBee firmware: 2%"
    . . .

  When the process completes, the following message is displayed:

    "Profile updated successfully!"

  If any error occurs during the process, it will be displayed in the console.

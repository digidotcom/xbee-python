Discover the XBee network
=========================

Several XBee modules working together and communicating with each other form a
network. XBee networks have different topologies and behaviors depending on the
protocol of the XBee nodes that form it.

The XBee Python Library includes a class, called ``XBeeNetwork``, to represent
the set of nodes forming the actual XBee network. This class allows you to
perform some operations related to the nodes.

.. note::
  There are ``XBeeNetwork`` subclasses for different protocols which correspond
  to the ``XBeeDevice`` subclasses:

  * XBee Zigbee network (``ZigBeeNetwork``)
  * XBee 802.15.4 network (``Raw802Network``)
  * XBee DigiMesh network (``DigiMeshNetwork``)
  * XBee DigiPoint network (``DigiPointNetwork``)

.. warning::
  Because XBee Cellular and Wi-Fi module protocols are directly connected to the
  Internet and do not share a connection, these protocols do not support XBee
  networks.

The XBee network object can be retrieved from a local XBee after it has been
opened with the method ``get_network()``.

**Retrieve the XBee network**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate a local XBee object.
  xbee = XBeeDevice("COM1", 9600)
  xbee.open()

  # Get the network.
  xnet = xbee.get_network()
  [...]

A main feature of the ``XBeeNetwork`` class is the ability to discover the XBee
nodes that form the network and store them in a internal list. The
``XBeeNetwork`` object provides the following operations related to the XBee
discovery feature:

* :ref:`discoveryTypes`
* :ref:`deepDiscovery`
* :ref:`standardDiscovery`
* :ref:`discoverNetwork`
* :ref:`accessDiscoveredDevices`
* :ref:`accessConnections`
* :ref:`addAndRemoveDevices`
* :ref:`listenToNetworkCacheModifications`


.. _discoveryTypes:

Discovery types
---------------

There are two different types of discovery processes available in this API:

* :ref:`deepDiscovery` finds network nodes and connections between them
  (including quality) even if they are sleeping. It also allows to establish a
  number of rounds to continually explore the network.

* :ref:`standardDiscovery` only identifies network nodes. It may not discover
  sleeping nodes.

See :ref:`discoverNetwork` to know how to launch a deep or standard discovery
process.

.. note::
  In 802.15.4, both (deep and standard discovery) are the same and none discover
  the node connections nor their quality. The difference is the possibility of
  running more than one round using a deep discovery.


.. _deepDiscovery:

Deep discovery
--------------

This discovery process finds network nodes and their connections including the
quality. It asks each node for its neighbors and retrieves information about
the signal quality between them.

This mechanism also discovers sleeping nodes.

It is possible to configure the discovery process to run a specific number of
times or even endlessly. Each discovery round is called a scan.


.. _deepDiscoveryMode:

Deep discovery modes
````````````````````

This mode establishes the way the network deep discovery process is performed.
Available modes are defined in the ``NeighborDiscoveryMode`` enumeration:

* **Cascade** (``NeighborDiscoveryMode.CASCADE``): The discovery of the
  neighbors of a node is requested once the previous request finishes. This
  means that just one discovery process is running at the same time.
  This mode is recommended for large networks, it might be a slower method but
  it generates less traffic than 'Flood'.

* **Flood** (``NeighborDiscoveryMode.FLOOD``): The discovery of the neighbors
  of a node is requested when the node is found in the network. This means that
  several discovery processes might be running at the same time.
  This might be a faster method, but it generates a lot of traffic and might
  saturate the network.

The default discovery mode is **Cascade**. You can configure the discovery mode
with the method ``set_deep_discovery_options()``.


.. _configDeepDiscoveryProcess:

Configure the deep discovery process
````````````````````````````````````

Before discovering the nodes of a network, you can configure the settings of the
process. The API provides two methods to configure the discovery timeout and
discovery options.

.. _standardDiscovery:

Standard discovery
------------------

This type of discovery process only finds network nodes, it does not include
information about the quality of the connections between them.

XBee nodes sleeping may not respond to this request, this means, it may not be
found using this discovery process type.

The discovery process runs until the configured timeout expires or, in case of
802.15.4, until the 'end' packet is received (see
:ref:`configStandardDiscoveryProcess`)

.. _discoverNetwork:

Discover the network
--------------------

The ``XBeeNetwork`` object discovery process allows you to discover and store
all the XBee nodes that form the network. The ``XBeeNetwork`` object provides a
method for executing a discovery process of the selected type:

+-----------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Method                                        | Description                                                                                                         |
+===============================================+=====================================================================================================================+
| **start_discovery_process(Boolean, Integer)** | Starts the discovery process, saving the remote XBee found inside the ``XBeeNetwork`` object.                       |
|                                               |                                                                                                                     |
|                                               |   * **deep (Boolean, optional)**: ``True`` for a deep network scan, ``False`` otherwise. See :ref:`discoveryTypes`. |
|                                               |   * **n_deep_scans (Integer, optional)**: Number of discovery scans to perform. Only for deep discovery.            |
+-----------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When a discovery process has started, you can monitor and manage it using the
following methods provided by the ``XBeeNetwork`` object:

+------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Method                       | Description                                              |
+==============================+==========================================================+
| **is_discovery_running()**   | Returns whether or not the discovery process is running. |
+------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| **stop_discovery_process()** | Stops the discovery process that is taking place.        |
+------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

.. warning::
  For a standard discovery and depending on your hardware and firmware version,
  although you call the ``stop_discovery_process()`` method, DigiMesh and
  DigiPoint modules are blocked until the configured discovery time has elapsed.
  This means, if you try to get or set any parameter during that time, a
  ``TimeoutException`` may be thrown. This does not occur for:

  * XBee 3 modules running DigiMesh firmware 300B or higher.
  * XBee SX modules running firmware A008 or higher, 9008 or higher.

Once the process has finished, you can retrieve the list of nodes that form
the network using the ``get_devices()`` method provided by the network object.
If the discovery process is running, this method returns ``None``.

All discovered XBee nodes are stored in the ``XBeeNetwork`` instance.

**Discover the network (deep)**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate a local XBee object.
  xbee = XBeeDevice(...)

  # Get the XBee network object from the local XBee.
  xnet = xbee.get_network()

  # Start the discovery process and wait for it to be over.
  xnet.start_discovery_process(deep=True, n_deep_scans=1)
  while xnet.is_discovery_running():
      time.sleep(0.5)

  # Get the list of the nodes in the network.
  nodes = xnet.get_devices()

  [...]


**Discover the network (standard)**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate a local XBee object.
  xbee = XBeeDevice(...)

  # Get the XBee network object from the local XBee.
  xnet = xbee.get_network()

  # Start the discovery process and wait for it to be over.
  xnet.start_discovery_process()
  while xnet.is_discovery_running():
      time.sleep(0.5)

  # Get the list of the nodes in the network.
  nodes = xnet.get_devices()

  [...]


Discover the network with an event notification
```````````````````````````````````````````````

The API also allows you to add a discovery event listener to notify when:

* New nodes are discovered.
* The process finishes.
* An error occurs during the process.

Notify new discovered nodes
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To get notifications when nodes are discovered, provide a callback before
starting the discovery process using the ``add_device_discovered_callback()``
method.

**Add a callback to device discovered event**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate a local XBee object.
  xbee = XBeeDevice(...)

  # Define the device discovered callback.
  def callback(remote):
      [...]

  # Get the XBee network object from the local XBee.
  xnet = xbee.get_network()

  # Add the device discovered callback.
  xnet.add_device_discovered_callback(callback)

  # Start the discovery process.
  xnet.start_discovery_process(deep=True)

  [...]

Every time a new remote XBee node is discovered all registered device discovered
callbacks are executed, even if the discovered node is already in the node list
of the network. Each callback receives a ``RemoteXBeeDevice`` as argument, with
all the available information. Unknown parameters of this remote node are
``None``.

Notify discovery finishes
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

To get notifications when a discovery process finishes, provide a callback
before starting the discovery process using the
``add_discovery_process_finished_callback()`` method.

**Add a callback to discovery process finished event**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate a local XBee object.
  xbee = XBeeDevice(...)

  # Define the discovery process finished callback.
  def callback(status):
      if status == NetworkDiscoveryStatus.ERROR_READ_TIMEOUT:
          [...]

  # Add the discovery process finished callback.
  xnet.add_discovery_process_finished_callback(callback)

  [...]

When a discovery process finishes (either successfully or with an error), all
registered discovery finished callbacks are executed. This method receives a
``NetworkDiscoveryStatus`` object as parameter. This status represents the
result of the network discovery process.

The ``XBeeNetwork`` object also provides methods to discover specific nodes
within a network. This may be useful, for example, to work with a particular

.. _addAndRemoveDevices:

Add and remove nodes manually
-----------------------------

This section provides information on methods for adding, removing, and clearing
the list of remote XBee nodes.

.. note::
  These methods modifies the list of nodes inside the ``XBeeNetwork`` object,
  but do not change the real XBee network. They do not trigger a node join
  event, a disassociation, or a network reset.

.. _listenToNetworkCacheModifications:

Listen to network modification events
-------------------------------------

When a discovery process finds new nodes that were not in the XBee network list
(``XBeeNetwork`` or a subclass), they are stored generating a modification event
in the XBee network object. A manual removal or addition of an XBee to the
network also launches modification events.

The XBee Python Library notifies about these network list modification events to
registered callbacks. These events inform about the following network
modifications:

* Addition of new nodes
* Removal of existing nodes
* Update of nodes
* Network clear

To receive any of these modification events, provide a callback using the
``add_network_modified_callback()`` method.
This callback must follow the format:

.. code:: python

  def my_net_modified_callback(event_type, reason, node):
      """
      Callback to notify about a new network modification event.

      Args:
        event_type (:class:`.NetworkEventType`): The type of modification.
        reason (:class:`.NetworkEventReason`): The cause of the modification.
        node (:class:`.AbstractXBeeDevice`): The node involved in the
          modification (``None`` for ``NetworkEventType.CLEAR`` events)
      """
      [...]

When a modification in the network list occurs, all network modification
callbacks are executed. Each callback receives the following arguments:

* The type of network modification as a ``NetworkEventType``
  (addition, removal, update or clear)
* The modification cause as a ``NetworkEventReason`` (discovered, discovered as
  neighbor, received message, hop of a network route, refresh node information,
  firmware update, manual)
* The XBee node, local or remote, (``AbstractXBeeDevice``) involved in the
  modification (``None`` for a clear event type)

**Register a network modifications callback**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Define the network modified callback.
  def cb_network_modified(event_type, reason, node):
      print("  >>>> Network event:")
      print("         Type: %s (%d)" % (event_type.description, event_type.code))
      print("         Reason: %s (%d)" % (reason.description, reason.code))

      if not node:
        return

      print("         Node:")
      print("            %s" % node)

  xnet = xbee.get_network()

  # Add the network modified callback.
  xnet.add_network_modified_callback(cb_network_modified)

  [...]

To stop listening to network modifications, use the
``del_network_modified_callback()`` method to unsubscribe the already-registered
callback.

**Deregister a network modification callback**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  def cb_network_modified(event_type, reason, node):
      [...]

  xbee.add_network_modified_callback(cb_network_modified)

  [...]

  # Delete the callback.
  xbee.del_network_modified_callback(cb_network_modified)

  [...]


Network events
``````````````

The ``NetworkEventType`` class enumerates the possible network cache
modification types:

* Addition (``NetworkEventType.ADD``): A new XBee has just been added to the
  network cache.
* Deletion (``NetworkEventType.DEL``): An XBee in the network cache has just
  been removed.
* Update (``NetworkEventType.UPDATE``): An existing XBee in the network cache
  has just been updated. This means any of its parameters (node id, 16-bit
  address, role, ...) changed.
* Clear (``NetworkEventType.CLEAR``): The network cached has just been cleared.

As well, ``NetworkEventReason`` enumerates the network modification causes:

* ``NetworkEventReason.DISCOVERED``: The node was added/removed/updated during
  a standard discovery process.
* ``NetworkEventReason.NEIGHBOR``: The node was added/removed/updated during
  a deep discovery process.
* ``NetworkEventReason.RECEIVED_MSG``: The node was added/updated after
  receiving a message from it.
* ``NetworkEventReason.ROUTE``: The node was added/updated as a hop of a
  received network route.
* ``NetworkEventReason.READ_INFO``: The node was updated after refreshing its
  information.
* ``NetworkEventReason.FIRMWARE_UPDATE``: The node was updated/removed, or the
  network cleared after a firmware update.
* ``NetworkEventReason.PROFILE_UPDATE``: The node was updated/removed, or the
  network cleared after applying a profile.
* ``NetworkEventReason.MANUAL``: The node was manually added/updated/removed, or
  the network cleared.

For example, if, during a deep discovery process, a new node is found and:

* it is not in the network list yet, the addition triggers a new event with:

  * type: ``NetworkEventType.ADD``
  * cause: ``NetworkEventReason.NEIGHBOR``

* it is already in the network list but its node identifier is updated, a new
  event is raised with:

  * type: ``NetworkEventType.UPDATE``
  * cause: ``NetworkEventReason.NEIGHBOR``

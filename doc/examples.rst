* Work with device's file system
* Apply XBee profiles
* Perform other common operations

All of the sample applications are contained in the examples folder, organized
by category. Every sample includes the source code and a **readme.txt** file
to clarify the purpose and the required setup to launch the application.

Examples are split by categories:

* :ref:`samplesConfiguration`

* :ref:`samplesFirmware`
* :ref:`samplesFilesystem`
* :ref:`samplesProfile`
* :ref:`samplesStatistics`


.. _samplesConfiguration:

Configuration samples
---------------------

Manage common parameters
````````````````````````

This sample application shows how to get and set common parameters of the XBee
device. Common parameters are split in cached and non-cached parameters. For
that reason, the application refreshes the cached parameters before reading and
displaying them. The application then configures, reads, and displays the value
of non-cached parameters.

The application uses the specific setters and getters provided by the XBee
device object to configure and read the different parameters.

You can locate the example in the following path:
**examples/configuration/ManageCommonParametersSample**

.. note::
   For more information about how to manage common parameters, see
   :ref:`configCommonParameters`.


Set and get parameters
``````````````````````

This sample application shows how to set and get parameters of a local or
remote XBee device. Use this method when you need to set or get the value of a
parameter that does not have its own getter and setter within the XBee device
object.

The application sets the value of four parameters with different value types:

* String
* Byte
* Array
* Integer

The application then reads the parameters from the device to verify that the
read values are the same as the values that were set.

You can locate the example in the following path:
**examples/configuration/SetAndGetParametersSample**

.. note::
   For more information about how to get and set other parameters, see
   :ref:`configOtherParameters`.


Reset module
````````````

This sample application shows how to perform a software reset on the local XBee
module.

You can locate the example in the following path:
**examples/configuration/ResetModuleSample**

.. note::
   For more information about how to reset a module, see
   :ref:`configReset`.

   :ref:`configWiFi`.


.. _samplesNetwork:

Network samples
---------------

Discover devices
````````````````

This sample application demonstrates how to obtain the XBee network object
from a local XBee device and discover the remote XBee devices that compose the
network. The example adds a discovery listener, so the callbacks provided by
the listener object receive the events.

The remote XBee devices are printed out as soon as they are found during
discovery.

You can locate the example in the following path:
**examples/network/DiscoverDevicesSample**

.. note::
   For more information about how to perform a network discovery, see
   :ref:`discoverNetwork`.


Network modifications sample
````````````````````````````

This sample application demonstrates how to listen to network modification
events. The example adds a modifications network callback, so modifications
events are received and printed out.

A network is modified when:

* a new node is added by discovering, manually, or because data is
  received from it
* an existing node is removed from the network
* an existing node is updated with new information
* it is fully cleared

You can locate the example in the following path:
**examples/network/NetworkModificationsSample**

.. note::
   For more information about how to listen to network modifications, see

Handle analog and digital IO lines
==================================

All the XBee modules, regardless of the protocol they run, have a set of IO
lines (pins). You can use these pins to connect sensors or actuators and
configure them with specific behavior.

You can configure the IO lines of an XBee device to be digital input/output
(DIO), analog to digital converter (ADC), or pulse-width modulation output
(PWM). The configuration you provide to a line depends on the device where you
want to connect.

.. note::
  All the IO management features displayed in this topic and sub-topics are
  applicable for both local and remote XBee devices.

The XBee Python Library exposes an easy way to configure, read, and write the
IO lines of the local and remote XBee devices through the following
corresponding classes:

* ``XBeeDevice`` for local devices.
* ``RemoteXBeeDevice`` for remotes.


Configure the IO lines
----------------------

All XBee device objects include a configuration method,
``set_io_configuration()``, where you can specify the IO line being configured
and the desired function being set.

For the IO line parameter, the API provides an enumerator called ``IOLine``
that helps you specify the desired IO line easily by functional name. This
enumerator is used along all the IO related methods in the API.

The supported functions are also contained in an enumerator called ``IOMode``.
You can choose between the following functions:

* DISABLED
* SPECIAL_FUNCTIONALITY (Shouldn't be used to configure IOs)
* PWM
* ADC
* DIGITAL_IN
* DIGITAL_OUT_LOW
* DIGITAL_OUT_HIGH

**Configure local or remote IO lines**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate an XBee device object.
  local_xbee = XBeeDevice("COM1", 9600)
  local_xbee.open()

  # Instantiate a remote XBee device object.
  remote_xbee = RemoteXBeeDevice(local_xbee, XBee64BitAddress.from_hex_string("0013A20012345678"))

  # Configure the DIO1_AD1 line of the local device to be Digital output (set high by default).
  local_xbee.set_io_configuration(IOLine.DIO1_AD1, IOMode.DIGITAL_OUT_HIGH)

  # Configure the DIO2_AD2 line of the local device to be Digital input.
  local_xbee.set_io_configuration(IOLine.DIO2_AD2, IOMode.DIGITAL_IN)

  # Configure the DIO3_AD3 line of the remote device to be Analog input (ADC).
  remote_xbee.set_io_configuration(IOLine.DIO3_AD3, IOMode.ADC)

  # Configure the DIO10_PWM0 line of the remote device to be PWM output (PWM).
  remote_xbee.set_io_configuration(IOLine.DIO10_PWM0, IOMode.PWM)

  [...]

The ``set_io_configuration()`` method may fail for the following reasons:

* ACK of the command sent is not received in the configured timeout, throwing
  a ``TimeoutException``.
* Other errors caught as ``XBeeException``:
    * The operating mode of the device is not ``API_MODE`` or
      ``ESCAPED_API_MODE``, throwing an ``InvalidOperatingModeException``.
    * The response of the command is not valid, throwing an
      ``ATCommandException``.
    * There is an error writing to the XBee interface, throwing a generic
      ``XBeeException``.

You can read the current configuration of any IO line the same way an IO line
can be configured with a desired function using the corresponding getter,
``get_io_configuration()``.

**Get IO configuration**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate an XBee device object.
  local_xbee = XBeeDevice("COM1", 9600)
  local_xbee.open()

  # Get the configuration mode of the DIO1_AD1 line.
  io_mode = local_xbee.get_io_configuration(IOLine.DIO1_AD1)

  [...]

The ``get_io_configuration()`` method may fail for the following reasons:

* ACK of the command sent is not received in the configured timeout, throwing
  a ``TimeoutException``.
* Other errors caught as ``XBeeException``:
    * The operating mode of the device is not ``API_MODE`` or
      ``ESCAPED_API_MODE``, throwing an ``InvalidOperatingModeException``.
    * The response of the command is not valid, throwing an
      ``ATCommandException``.
    * There is an error writing to the XBee interface, throwing a generic
      ``XBeeException``.


.. _linesDIO:

Digital Input/Output
````````````````````

If your IO line is configured as digital output, you can set its state
(high/low) easily. All the XBee device classes provide the method,
``set_dio_value()``, with the desired ``IOLine`` as the first parameter and an
``IOValue`` as the second. The ``IOValue`` enumerator includes ``HIGH`` and
``LOW`` as possible values.

**Set digital output values**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate an XBee device object.
  local_xbee = XBeeDevice("COM1", 9600)
  local_xbee.open()

  # Set the DIO2_AD2 line low.
  local_xbee.set_dio_value(IOLine.DIO2_AD2, IOValue.LOW)

  # Set the DIO2_AD2 line high.
  local_xbee.set_dio_value(IOLine.DIO2_AD2, IOValue.HIGH)

  [...]

The ``set_dio_value()`` method may fail for the following reasons:

* ACK of the command sent is not received in the configured timeout, throwing
  a ``TimeoutException``.
* Other errors caught as ``XBeeException``:
    * The operating mode of the device is not ``API_MODE`` or
      ``ESCAPED_API_MODE``, throwing an ``InvalidOperatingModeException``.
    * The response of the command is not valid, throwing an
      ``ATCommandException``.
    * There is an error writing to the XBee interface, throwing a generic
      ``XBeeException``.

You can also read the current status of the pin (high/low) by issuing the
method ``get_dio_value()``. The parameter of the method must be the IO line to
be read.

**Read digital input values**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate an XBee device object.
  local_xbee = XBeeDevice("COM1", 9600)
  local_xbee.open()

  # Get the value of the DIO2_AD2.
  value = local_xbee.get_dio_value(IOLine.DIO2_AD2)

  [...]

The ``get_dio_value()`` method may fail for the following reasons:

* ACK of the command sent is not received in the configured timeout, throwing
  a ``TimeoutException``.
* Other errors caught as ``XBeeException``:
    * The operating mode of the device is not ``API_MODE`` or
      ``ESCAPED_API_MODE``, throwing an ``InvalidOperatingModeException``.
    * If the received response does not contain the value for the given IO
      line, throwing an ``OperationNotSupportedException``. This can happen (for
      example) if you try to read the DIO value of an IO line that is not
      configured as DIO.
    * The response of the command is not valid, throwing an
      ``ATCommandException``.
    * There is an error writing to the XBee interface, throwing a generic
      ``XBeeException``.

.. _linesADC:

ADC
```

When you configure an IO line as analog to digital converter (ADC), you can
only read its value (counts) with ``get_adc_value()``. In this case, the method
used to read ADCs is different than the digital I/O method, but the parameter
provided is the same: the IO line to read the value from.

**Read ADC values**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate an XBee device object.
  local_xbee = XBeeDevice("COM1", 9600)
  local_xbee.open()

  [...]

  # Get the value of the DIO 3 (analog to digital converter).
  value = local_xbee.get_adc_value(IOLine.DIO3_AD3)

  [...]

The ``get_adc_value()`` method may fail for the following reasons:

* ACK of the command sent is not received in the configured timeout, throwing
  a ``TimeoutException``.
* Other errors caught as `XBeeException`:
    * The operating mode of the device is not ``API_MODE`` or
      ``ESCAPED_API_MODE``, throwing an ``InvalidOperatingModeException``.
    * If the received response does not contain the value for the given IO
      line, throwing an ``OperationNotSupportedException``. This can happen (for
      example) if you try to read the ADC value of an IO line that is not
      configured as ADC.

PWM
```

Not all the XBee protocols support pulse-width modulation (PWM) output
handling, but the XBee Python Library provides functionality to manage them.
When you configure an IO line as PWM output, you must use specific methods to
set and read the duty cycle of the PWM.

For the set case, use the method ``set_pwm_duty_cycle()`` and provide the IO
line configured as PWM and the value of the duty cycle in % of the PWM. The
duty cycle is the proportion of 'ON' time to the regular interval or 'period'
of time. A high duty cycle corresponds to high power, because the power is ON
for most of the time. The percentage parameter of the set duty cycle method is
a double, which allows you to be more precise in the configuration.

**Set the duty cycle of an IO line configure as PWM**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate an XBee device object.
  local_xbee = XBeeDevice("COM1", 9600)
  local_xbee.open()

  [...]

  # Set a duty cycle of 75% to the DIO10_PWM0 line (PWM output).
  local_xbee.set_pwm_duty_cycle(IOLine.DIO10_PWM0, 75)

  [...]

The ``set_pwm_duty_cycle()`` method may fail for the following reasons:

* ACK of the command sent is not received in the configured timeout, throwing
  a ``TimeoutException``.
* Other errors caught as ``XBeeException``:
    * The operating mode of the device is not ``API_MODE`` or
      ``ESCAPED_API_MODE``, throwing an ``InvalidOperatingModeException``.
    * The response of the command is not valid, throwing an
      ``ATCommandException``.
    * There is an error writing to the XBee interface, throwing a generic
      ``XBeeException``.

The ``get_pwm_duty_cycle(IOLine)`` method of a PWM line returns a double value
with the current duty cycle percentage of the PWM.

**Get the duty cycle of an IO line configured as PWM**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate an XBee device object.
  local_xbee = XBeeDevice("COM1", 9600)
  local_xbee.open()

  [...]

  # Get the duty cycle of the DIO10_PWM0 line (PWM output).
  duty_cycle = local_xbee.get_pwm_duty_cycle(IOLine.DIO10_PWM0);

  [...]

.. note::
  In both cases (get and set), the IO line provided must be PWM capable and must
  be configured as PWM output.


.. _linesReadIOSamples:

Read IO samples
---------------

XBee modules can monitor and sample the analog and digital IO
lines. You can read IO samples locally or transmitted to a remote device to
provide an indication of the current IO line states.

There are three ways to obtain IO samples on a local or remote device:

* Queried sampling
* Periodic sampling
* Change detection sampling

The XBee Python Library represents an IO sample by the ``IOSample`` class, which
contains:

* Digital and analog channel masks that indicate which lines have sampling
  enabled.
* Values of those enabled lines.

You must configure the IO lines you want to receive in the IO samples before
enabling sampling.


Queried sampling
````````````````

The XBee Python Library provides a method to read an IO sample that contains
all enabled digital IO and analog input channels, ``read_io_sample()``. The
method returns an IOSample object.

**Read an IO sample and getting the DIO value**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate an XBee device object.
  local_xbee = XBeeDevice("COM1", 9600)
  local_xbee.open()

  [...]

  # Read an IO sample from the device.
  io_sample = local_xbee.read_io_sample()

  # Select the desired IO line.
  io_line = IOLine.DIO3_AD3

  # Check if the IO sample contains the expected IO line and value.
  if io_sample.has_digital_value(io_line):
      print("DIO3 value: %s" % io_sample.get_digital_value(ioLine))

  [...]

The ``read_io_sample()`` method may fail for the following reasons:

* ACK of the command sent is not received in the configured timeout, throwing
  a ``TimeoutException``.
* Other errors caught as ``XBeeException``:
    * The operating mode of the device is not ``API_MODE`` or
      ``ESCAPED_API_MODE``, throwing an ``InvalidOperatingModeException``.
    * The response of the command is not valid, throwing an
      ``ATCommandException``.
    * There is an error writing to the XBee interface, throwing a generic
      ``XBeeException``.


Periodic sampling
`````````````````

Periodic sampling allows an XBee module to take an IO sample and transmit it
to a remote device at a periodic rate. That remote device is defined in the
destination address through the ``set_dest_address()`` method. The XBee Python
Library provides the ``set_io_sampling_rate()`` method to configure the periodic
sampling.

The XBee module samples and transmits all enabled digital IO and analog inputs
to the remote device every X seconds. A sample rate of 0 s disables this
feature.

**Set the IO sampling rate**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate an XBee device object.
  local_xbee = XBeeDevice("COM1", 9600)
  local_xbee.open()

  [...]

  # Set the destination address.
  local_xbee.set_dest_address(XBee64BitAddress.from_hex_string("0013A20040XXXXXX"))

  # Set the IO sampling rate.
  local_xbee.set_io_sampling_rate(5)  # 5 seconds.

  [...]

The ``set_io_sampling_rate()`` method may fail for the following reasons:

* ACK of the command sent is not received in the configured timeout, throwing
  a ``TimeoutException``.
* Other errors caught as ``XBeeException``:
    * The operating mode of the device is not ``API_MODE`` or
      ``ESCAPED_API_MODE``, throwing an ``InvalidOperatingModeException``.
    * The response of the command is not valid, throwing an
      ``ATCommandException``.
    * There is an error writing to the XBee interface, throwing a generic
      ``XBeeException``.

You can also read this value using the ``get_io_sampling_rate()`` method. This
method returns the IO sampling rate in milliseconds and '0' when the feature
is disabled.

**Get the IO sampling rate**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate an XBee device object.
  local_xbee = XBeeDevice("COM1", 9600)
  local_xbee.open()

  [...]

  # Get the IO sampling rate.
  value = local_xbee.get_io_sampling_rate()

  [...]

The ``get_io_sampling_rate()`` method may fail for the following reasons:

* ACK of the command sent is not received in the configured timeout, throwing
  a ``TimeoutException``.
* Other errors caught as ``XBeeException``:
    * The operating mode of the device is not ``API_MODE`` or
      ``ESCAPED_API_MODE``, throwing an ``InvalidOperatingModeException``.
    * The response of the command is not valid, throwing an
      ``ATCommandException``.
    * There is an error writing to the XBee interface, throwing a generic
      ``XBeeException``.


Change detection sampling
-------------------------

You can configure modules to transmit a data sample immediately whenever a
monitored digital IO pin changes state. The ``set_dio_change_detection()``
method establishes the set of digital IO lines that are monitored for change
detection. A ``None`` set disables the change detection sampling.

As in the periodic sampling, change detection samples are transmitted to the
configured destination address.

.. note::
  This feature only monitors and samples digital IOs, so it is not valid for
  analog lines.

**Set the DIO change detection**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate an XBee device object.
  local_xbee = XBeeDevice("COM1", 9600)
  local_xbee.open()

  [...]

  # Set the destination address.
  local_xbee.set_dest_address(XBee64BitAddress.from_hex_string("0013A20040XXXXXX"))

  # Create a set of IO lines to be monitored.
  lines = [IOLine.DIO3_AD3, IOLine.DIO4_AD4]

  # Enable the DIO change detection sampling.
  local_xbee.set_dio_change_detection(lines)

  [...]

The ``set_dio_change_detection()`` method may fail for the following reasons:

* ACK of the command sent is not received in the configured timeout, throwing
  a ``TimeoutException``.
* Other errors caught as ``XBeeException``:
    * The operating mode of the device is not ``API_MODE`` or
      ``ESCAPED_API_MODE``, throwing an ``InvalidOperatingModeException``.
    * The response of the command is not valid, throwing an
      ``ATCommandException``.
    * There is an error writing to the XBee interface, throwing a generic
      ``XBeeException``.

You can also get the lines that are monitored using the
``get_dio_change_detection()`` method. A ``None`` value indicates that this
feature is disabled.

**Get the DIO change detection**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate an XBee device object.
  local_xbee = XBeeDevice("COM1", 9600)
  local_xbee.open()

  [...]

  # Get the set of lines that are monitored.
  lines = local_xbee.get_dio_change_detection()

  [...]

The ``get_dio_change_detection()`` method may fail for the following reasons:

* ACK of the command sent is not received in the configured timeout, throwing
  a ``TimeoutException``.
* Other errors caught as ``XBeeException``:
    * The operating mode of the device is not ``API_MODE`` or
      ``ESCAPED_API_MODE``, throwing an ``InvalidOperatingModeException``.
    * The response of the command is not valid, throwing an
      ``ATCommandException``.
    * There is an error writing to the XBee interface, throwing a generic
      ``XBeeException``.


Register an IO sample listener
``````````````````````````````

In addition to configuring an XBee device to monitor and sample the analog and
digital IO lines, you must register a callback in the local device where you
want to receive the IO samples. You are then notified when the device receives
a new IO sample.

You must subscribe to the IO samples reception service by using the method
``add_io_sample_received_callback()`` with an IO sample reception callback
function as parameter.

**Add an IO sample callback**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate an XBee device object.
  local_xbee = XBeeDevice("COM1", 9600)
  local_xbee.open()

  [...]

  # Define the IO sample receive callback.
  def io_sample_callback(io_sample, remote_xbee, send_time):
      print("IO sample received at time %s." % str(send_time))
      print("IO sample:")
      print(str(io_sample))

  # Subscribe to IO samples reception.
  local_xbee.add_io_sample_received_callback(io_sample_callback)

  [...]

This callback function will receive three parameters when an IO sample receive
event is raised:

* The received IO sample as an ``IOSample`` object.
* The remote XBee device that sent the IO sample as a ``RemoteXBeeDevice``
  object.
* The time in which the IO sample was received as an ``Float`` (calculated
  with Python standard ``time.time()``).

To stop receiving notifications of new IO samples, remove the added callback
using the ``del_io_sample_received_callback()`` method.

**Remove an IO sample callback**

.. code:: python

  [...]

  # Instantiate an XBee device object.
  local_xbee = XBeeDevice("COM1", 9600)
  local_xbee.open()

  [...]

  # Define the IO sample receive callback.
  def io_sample_callback(io_sample, remote_xbee, send_time):
      print("IO sample received at time %s." % str(send_time))
      print("IO sample:")
      print(str(io_sample))

  # Subscribe to IO samples reception by adding the callback.
  local_xbee.add_io_sample_received_callback(io_sample_callback)

  [...]

  # Unsubscribe from IO samples reception by removing the callback.
  local_xbee.del_io_sample_received_callback(io_sample_callback)

  [...]

The ``del_io_sample_received_callback()`` method will raise a ``ValueError`` if
you try to delete a callback that you have not added yet.

Get started with XBee Python library
====================================

This getting started guide describes how to set up your environment and use
the XBee Python Library to communicate with your XBee devices. It explains
how to configure your modules and write your first XBee Python application.

The guide is split into 3 main sections:

* :ref:`gsgInstall`
* :ref:`gsgConfigure`
* :ref:`gsgRunApp`


.. _gsgInstall:

Install your software
---------------------

The following software components are required to write and run your first
XBee Python application:

* :ref:`gsgInstallPython3`
* :ref:`gsgInstallPySerial3`
* :ref:`gsgInstallSRP`
* :ref:`gsgInstallXBeePythonLibrarySoftware`
* :ref:`gsgInstallXCTU`


.. _gsgInstallPython3:

Python 3
````````

The XBee Python library requires Python 3. If you don't have
Python 3, you can get it from https://www.python.org/getit/.

.. warning::
   The XBee Python library is currently only compatible with Python 3.


.. _gsgInstallPySerial3:

PySerial 3
``````````

You must be able to communicate with the radio modules over a serial 
connection. The XBee Python library uses the **PySerial** module for that 
functionality.

This module is automatically downloaded when you install the XBee Python 
library.


.. _gsgInstallSRP:

SRP
```

The XBee Python library uses the **SRP** module to authenticate with
XBee devices over Bluetooth Low Energy.

This module is automatically downloaded when you install the XBee Python
library.


.. _gsgInstallXBeePythonLibrarySoftware:

XBee Python library software
````````````````````````````

The best way to install the XBee Python library is with the
`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable>`_ tool (which is what Python uses to
install packages). The pip tool comes with recent versions of Python.

To install the library, run this command in your terminal application:

.. code::

  $ pip install digi-xbee

The library is automatically downloaded and installed in your Python
interpreter.


Get the source code
*******************

The XBee Python library is actively developed on GitHub, where the code is
`always available <https://github.com/digidotcom/xbee-python>`_. You can
clone the repository with:

.. code::

  $ git clone git@github.com:digidotcom/xbee-python.git


.. _gsgInstallXCTU:

XCTU
````

XCTU is a free multi-platform application that enables developers to interact
with Digi RF modules through a simple-to-use graphical interface. It includes
new tools that make it easy to set up, configure, and test XBee RF modules.

For instructions on downloading and using XCTU, go to:

http://www.digi.com/xctu

Once you have downloaded XCTU, run the installer and follow the steps to finish
the installation process.

After you load XCTU, a message about software updates appears. We recommend you
always update XCTU to the latest available version.


.. _gsgConfigure:

Configure your XBee modules
---------------------------

You need to configure **two XBee devices**. One module (the sender) sends
“Hello XBee World!” using the Python application. The other device (the
receiver) receives the message.

To communicate, both devices must be working in the same protocol (802.15.4, 
Zigbee, DigiMesh, Point-to-Multipoint, or Wi-Fi) and must be configured to
operate in the same network.

.. note::
   If you are getting started with cellular, you only need to configure one
   device. Cellular protocol devices are connected directly to the Internet, 
   so there is no network of remote devices to communicate with them. For
   the cellular protocol, the XBee application demonstrated in the getting
   started guide differs from other protocols. The cellular protocol sends and
   reads data from an echo server.

.. note::
   If you are getting started with the BLU, you only need to configure one
   device. For the BLE protocol, the XBee application demonstrated in the
   getting started guide differs from other protocols, and will show
   how to receive Generic Access Profile (GAP) broadcasts from other
   BLE devices.

Use XCTU to configure the devices. Plug the devices into the XBee adapters and
connect them to your computer’s USB or serial ports.

.. note::
   For more information about XCTU, see the `XCTU User
   Guide <https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001458-13>`_.
   You can also access the documentation from the Help menu of the tool.

Once XCTU is running, add your devices to the tool and then select them from
the **Radio Modules** section. When XCTU is finished reading the device
parameters, complete the following steps according to your device type.
Repeat these steps to configure your XBee devices using XCTU.

.. _gsgRunApp:

Run your first XBee Python application
--------------------------------------

The XBee Python application demonstrated in the guide broadcasts the message
*Hello XBee World!* from one of the devices connected to your computer (the
sender) to all remote devices on the same network as the sender. Once the
message is sent, the receiver XBee module must receive it. You can use XCTU 
to verify receipt.

The commands to be executed depend on the protocol of the XBee devices. Follow 
the corresponding steps depending on the protocol of your XBee devices.

* :ref:`gsgAppZBDMDP802`
* :ref:`gsgAppWiFi`
* :ref:`gsgAppCellular`
* :ref:`gsgAppBlu`


.. _gsgAppZBDMDP802:

Zigbee, DigiMesh, DigiPoint or 802.15.4 devices
```````````````````````````````````````````````

Follow these steps to send the broadcast message and verify that it is received
successfully:

#. First, prepare the *receiver* XBee device in XCTU to verify
   that the broadcast message sent by the *sender* device is received
   successfully. Follow these steps to do so:

   #. Launch XCTU.
   #. Add the *receiver* module to XCTU.
   #. Click **Open the serial connection with the radio module** to switch to
      **Consoles working mode** and open the serial connection. This allows
      you to see the data when it is received.

#. Open the Python interpreter and write the application commands.

   #. Import the ``XBeeDevice`` class by executing the following command:

      .. code::

        > from digi.xbee.devices import XBeeDevice

   #. Instantiate a generic XBee device:

      .. code::

        > device = XBeeDevice("COM1", 9600)

      .. note::
         Remember to replace the COM port with the one your *sender* XBee device
         is connected to. In UNIX-based systems, the port usually starts with
         ``/dev/tty``.

   #. Open the connection with the device:

      .. code::

        > device.open()

   #. Send the *Hello XBee World!* broadcast message.

      .. code::

        > device.send_data_broadcast("Hello XBee World!")

   #. Close the connection with the device:

      .. code::

        > device.close()

#. Verify that the message is received by the *receiver* XBee in XCTU. An
   **RX (Receive) frame** should be displayed in the **Console log** with the
   following information:

   +--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Start delimiter          | 7E                                                 |
   +--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Length                   | Depends on the XBee protocol                       |

   +--------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+


.. _gsgAppWiFi:

Wi-Fi devices
`````````````

Wi-Fi devices send broadcast data using the ``send_ip_data_broadcast()``
command instead of the ``send_data_broadcast()`` one. For that reason, you must
instantiate a ``WiFiDevice`` instead of a generic ``XBeeDevice`` to execute the 
proper command.

Follow these steps to send the broadcast message and verify that it is received
successfully:

#. First, prepare the *receiver* XBee device in XCTU to verify
   that the broadcast message sent by the *sender* device is received
   successfully by the *receiver* device.

   #. Launch XCTU.
   #. Add the *receiver* module to XCTU.
   #. Click **Open the serial connection with the radio module** to switch to
      **Consoles working mode** and open the serial connection. This allows
      you to see the data when it is received.

#. Open the Python interpreter and write the application commands.

   #. Import the ``WiFiDevice`` class by executing the following command:

      .. code::

        > from digi.xbee.devices import WiFiDevice

   #. Instantiate a Wi-Fi XBee device:

      .. code::

        > device = WiFiDevice("COM1", 9600)

      .. note::
         Remember to replace the COM port with the one your *sender* XBee device
         is connected to. In UNIX-based systems, the port usually starts with
         ``/dev/tty``.

   #. Open the connection with the device:

      .. code::

        > device.open()

   #. Send the *Hello XBee World!* broadcast message.

      .. code::

        > device.send_ip_data_broadcast(9750, "Hello XBee World!")

   #. Close the connection with the device:

      .. code::

        > device.close()

#. Verify that the message is received by the *receiver* XBee in XCTU. An
   **RX IPv4 frame** should be displayed in the **Console log** with the
   following information:

   +---------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Start delimiter     | 7E                                                 |

.. _gsgAppCellular:

Cellular devices
````````````````

Cellular devices are connected directly to the Internet, so there is no
network of remote devices to communicate with them. For cellular
protocol, the application demonstrated in this guide differs from other
protocols.

The application sends and reads data from an echo server. Follow these steps to
execute it:

#. Open the Python interpreter and write the application commands.

   #. Import the ``CellularDevice``, ``IPProtocol`` and ``IPv4Address``
      classes:

      .. code::

        > from digi.xbee.devices import CellularDevice
        > from digi.xbee.models.protocol import IPProtocol
        > from ipaddress import IPv4Address

   #. Instantiate a cellular XBee device:

      .. code::

        > device = CellularDevice("COM1", 9600)

      .. note::
         Remember to replace the COM port by the one your Cellular XBee device
         is connected to. In UNIX-based systems, the port usually starts with
         ``/dev/tty``.

   #. Open the connection with the device:

      .. code::

        > device.open()

   #. Send the *Hello XBee World!* message to the echo server with IP
      *52.43.121.77* and port *11001* using the *TCP IP* protocol.

      .. code::

        > device.send_ip_data(IPv4Address("52.43.121.77"), 11001, IPProtocol.TCP, "Hello XBee World!")

   #. Read and print the response from the echo server. If response cannot be
      received, print *ERROR*.

      .. code::

        > ip_message = device.read_ip_data()
        > print(ip_message.data.decode("utf8") if ip_message is not None else "ERROR")

   #. Close the connection with the device:

      .. code::

        > device.close()


.. _gsgAppBlu:

BLU devices
````````````````

BLU devices are stand alone devices, so there is no network
of remote devices to communicate with them. For the BLE
protocol, the application demonstrated in this guide differs from other
protocols.

The application will issue a GAP Scan request, and display the return:

#. Open the Python interpreter and write the application commands.

   #. Import the ``BluDevice`` class by executing the following command:

      .. code::

        > from digi.xbee.devices import BluDevice

   #. Instantiate a Blu XBee device:

      .. code::

        > device = BluDevice("COM1", 9600)

      .. note::
         Remember to replace the COM port with the one your *sender* XBee device
         is connected to. In UNIX-based systems, the port usually starts with
         ``/dev/tty``.

   #. Open the connection with the device:

      .. code::

        > ble_manager = device.get_ble_manager()
        > device.open()

   #. Create a callback function for live GAP scan results

      .. code::

        > def scan_callback(data):
        >     print(data.to_dict())

   #. Tell the BLE manager to send the live GAP scan results to that callback

      .. code::

        > ble_manager.add_ble_gap_advertisement_received_callback(scan_callback)

   #. Tell the BLE manager to start scanning for 30 seconds

      .. code::

        > ble_manager.start_ble_gap_scan(30, 10000, 10000, False, "")

   #. Remove the callback, and close the connection with the device:

      .. code::

        > ble_manager.del_ble_gap_advertisement_received_callback(scan_callback)
        > device.close()

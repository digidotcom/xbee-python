  Introduction
  ------------
  This sample Python application shows how to apply an existing XBee profile
  to a remote XBee device.

  The application provides the profile file to the update method as well as a
  callback function to be notified of progress.

  NOTE: This example uses the generic XBee device (XBeeDevice) class, but it
        can be applied to any other local device class.


  Requirements
  ------------
  To run this example you will need:

    * At least two XBee radios in API mode and their corresponding carrier
      board (XBIB or equivalent).
    * The XCTU application (available at www.digi.com/xctu).
    * The XBee profile file to update the device.


  Compatible hardware
  --------------------
    * XBee 3 devices


  Compatible protocols
  --------------------
    * 802.15.4
    * DigiMesh
    * ZigBee


  Example setup
  -------------
    1) Plug the XBee radios into the XBee adapters and connect them to your
       computer's USB or serial ports.

    2) Configure the remote XBee device with the Node Identifier you will use
       in the example to communicate with it. To do so follow these steps:

          1) Launch the XCTU application.

          2) Add the remote XBee module to the XCTU, specifying it's port
             settings.

          3) Once the module is added, open the 'Configuration' working mode,
             look for the 'NI' setting and configure it with the name you will
             use in the example.

             Notice that by default the 'NI' setting has a blank space
             configured, make sure that there is not a blank space before the
             'REMOTE' text.

    3) Ensure that the modules are in API mode.
       For further information on how to perform this task, read the
       'Configuring Your XBee Modules' topic of the Getting Started guide.

    4) Set the port and baud rate of the local XBee radio in the sample file
       class. If you configured the module in the previous step with the XCTU.

    5) Configure the Node ID (NI) of the remote XBee device in the sample file.

    6) Configure the path of the XBee profile file in the sample file class.


  Running the example
  -------------------
  First, build and launch the application. To test the functionality, check
  that the output console displays this message:

    "Updating profile '<profile_path>'..."

  Followed by percentage progress messages by task:

    "Updating XBee firmware: 1%"
    "Updating XBee firmware: 2%"
    . . .

  When the process completes, the following message is displayed:

    "Profile updated successfully!"

  If any error occurs during the process, it will be displayed in the console.
